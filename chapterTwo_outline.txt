Difference between classification & regression problem
  * What a classification problem is
  * What a regression problem is
  * Give example of spam classifier vs. ex. of Boston House
    prices dataset

Metrics & How they're Useful
  * Accuracy Score
    - Computes % correctly guessed (classification)
    - http://machinelearningmastery.com/classification-accuracy-is-not-enough-more-performance-measures-you-can-use/
    - Its not entirely the best to use because it doesn't take
      into consideration low occurence of certain numbers (see
      example above)
  * Area Under Curve
    - http://fastml.com/what-you-wanted-to-know-about-auc/
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic
    - Explain an ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve
    - Explain how AUC just computer the area under this curve
    - "When using normalized units, the area under the curve (often referred to as simply the AUC, or AUROC) is equal to the probability that a classifier will rank a randomly chosen positive instance higher than a randomly chosen negative one (assuming 'positive' ranks higher than 'negative')."
  * Precision Score
    - True Positives over False & True Positives
    - How many selected items are relevant?
    - ex. of cancer diagnosis.
    - ex. of where having a false positive is detrimental
  * Recall Score
    - True Positives over True Positives & False Negatives
    - How many relevant items are selected?
    - ex. of situation where bagging every important part is
      necesary.
    - Counter-ex would be where somebody could sift through
      found items (low-precision, high-recall) vs. the african
      spammers (high-precision, low-recall). Human-intervention
    - Mention precision-recall curve here <http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jdavis/davisgoadrichcamera2.pdf>
  * Average Precision Score
    - Corresponds to area under precision-recall curve
    - https://sanchom.wordpress.com/2011/09/01/precision-recall/
    - http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/157012/area-under-precision-recall-curve-auc-of-pr-curve-and-average-precision-ap
    - Single number used to summarize recall and precision
  * Confusion Matrix
    - Simple way to summarize how one's classification is
      coming along.
    - Give ex. of perfect classification in confusion matrix.
  * Log Loss
    - Relies on probability
    - gives indication as to how confident the classifier is

Regression Metrics
  * mean absolute error
    - just show the formula and explain it
  * mean squared error
    - gives higher weight to large errors than absolute error
  * r2-score
    - gives idea as to how approximately relevant a classifier

Objectives [ Drop this section? ]
  * what is an objective?
    - how keras works with object errors when training neural
      networks
    - generally not too important to worry over unless you're
      gaming for theoretical justification
  * mean_squared_error
    - see above
  * mean_absolute_error
    - see above
  * mean_absolute_percentage_score
    - ? to-do
  * mean_squared_logarithmic_error
    - ? to-do
  * squared_hinge
    - https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-decide-which-loss-function-to-use-for-machine-learning
  * hinge

  * binary_crossentropy
    - primary method for binary classification
  * categorical_crossentropy
    - for multi-class classification
