Chapter 5. What about time series data? Classifying Text?

    - keras.layers.recurrent.LSTM
  - Example Datasets
    - IMDB
    - Reuters
    - I need a plain 'ol time series dataset!

Recurrent Neural Networks
  * Explain what they are (https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/)
  * Explain some attributes about them
    - 'stateful'ness for reusing computed states as the initial states for the
      samples in the next batch
    - 'consume_less' for CPU vs GPU usage
    - 'unroll'ing a network
      > http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/recurrent-neural-networks-tutorial-part-1-introduction-to-rnns/
      > more memory intensive
      > the whole network is computer as a monolith (unrolled) vs as a pastiche of
        pieces (rolled).
