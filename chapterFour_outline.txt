Chapter 4. How do we classify Images?
  - Convolutional Neural Networks
    - Start with dense layers like before, but mention how ineffective they are
    - keras.layers.core.Reshape >>> this might fit better in chapter 3
    - keras.layers.convolution.Convolution2D
    - keras.layers.pooling.MaxPooling2D
    - keras.layers.pooling.AveragePooling2D
  - Example Datasets
    - Cifar
    - Cifar10
    - Cifar100

Convolutional Neural Networks
  * Explain the history with relevant papers
  * Use the example of MNIST to show how effective CNNs can be vs. Dense MLPs
  * What a convolution does --> algorithm and hands-wavey explanation
  * What MaxPooling does
  * What AveragePooling does

Examples (do arbitrary, guts-first ideas)
  * Cifar
    - might be too bit to do straight up
  * Cifar10
  * Cifar100

Complex Examples
  * VGG16
  * Prof. Hinton's winner in 2010
  * etc. etc. (Keras' website should have examples included)
