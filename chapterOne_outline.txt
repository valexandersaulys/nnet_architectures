Chapter 1. Why Keras?
  - What is a Neural Network?
  - Purposes of a Neural Network Library
    - Differences between something a LinAlg library, tensorflow/theano, and
      Keras.
    - Mention Scikit-Learn
  - Tensorflow & Theano as Backends
    - Histories
    - Differences
  - How to Install
    - Linux
    - Mac OS X
    - Windows (will be tough to do)
    - Also include Scikit-Learn for metrics

What is a Neural Network?
  * Give motivation & background on ML-connected world
  * Talk about what machine learning is
  * Talk about what AI is (difference with ML)
  * Shift in ML vs. traditional ways of writing programs
  * Explain what a neural network is (class of ML)
  * Why I wrote this book

Purpose of a Neural Network Library?
  * What a computer library is
  * What nnet libraries solved
    (1) reliance on cpu
    (2) lack of comprehension as history progressed
    (3) networking of computers
  * What Keras is
    - how frameworks work and why they're powerful
    - Tensorflow vs. Theano

How to Install
  * Linux
  * Mac
  * Windows (to-do...)
  * Scikit-Learn and NumPy
